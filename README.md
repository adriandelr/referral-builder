## Important Notes

- This is built using **NextJS** and **Tailwind UI** framework.
- It showcases the usage of classes across elements and its responsiveness.
- For mocking the API **users**, [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) was used.
- `LASTNAME` is replaced with `USERNAME`, since there is no last name provided from the fake API.
- **Adding actual referral data does not work** when using mocks, so **updating a newely added referral would result to an error**.
- It is my intention to exclude fields of `ADDRESS`.
- If you have any concerns, let me know.
